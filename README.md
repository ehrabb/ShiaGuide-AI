# ShiaGuide-AI

## 🌟 Our Vision

**ShiaGuide-AI** aspires to become the world’s most trusted digital companion for reviving the authentic teachings of the **Qur’an** and **Ahl al-Bayt (AS)** in the modern age.  
This AI platform will illuminate the path of **Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)** and his pure progeny, relying exclusively on **Shia sources**.

Our goal is to ensure that every seeker of truth can understand their **faith**, **rituals**, and **ethics** through the lens of **verified Shia scholarship**.

We pledge to make religious guidance both **accessible and profound**—integrating the **jurisprudential manuals (resalah)** of all respected Shia maraji to help users follow their chosen authority with clarity.

By prioritizing **Shia-authored Qur’anic translations and tafsir**, we strive to promote **unity, authenticity, and simplicity**—bridging the gap between sacred knowledge and daily practice for generations to come.
